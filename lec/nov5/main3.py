# Complexity of arithmetic operations

# Arithmetic operations on floats take a constant amount of time

# x + y
# x = dsifjvfv
# y = wetbtrfb

#  dsifjvfv
# +wetbtrfb

# Addition is O(n) where n is the number of digits
# the number N has approximately log(N) digits
# Addition is O(log(N)), where N = max(x, y)

# x * y
#  dsifjvfv
# *wetbtrfb

# n^2 multiplications, n^2 additions
# Long multiplication is O(n^2) where n is the number of digits in the larger of x and y

# Karatsuba's algorithm of multiplication O(n^1.68)
